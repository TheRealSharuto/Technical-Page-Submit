                                    Hello! My name is Shara Belton and in this document I will presenting the technical
                                    process of a Design Sprint in UX Design. This Technical Document has the purpose of
                                    not only being a submitable project for the awesome website FreeCodeCamp.org, but
                                    also a drill down of information for my own brain as I go through my Google UX
                                    Design Course. There will be two versions of this document. The first will be a
                                    submittable version that will adhere to all the requirements of the Technical Page
                                    Project on FreeCodeCamp. The other version will be a bit more creative with how the
                                    information is presented, for I will go back and make edits as I learn more
                                    Javascript with my current HTML/CSS knowledge. This other version will also have
                                    more information about UX Design that is less of a information dump straight out of
                                    my course, but a rewiring of information from my own brain to put into my own words
                                    as if I am explaining from memory to other people. Additionally, I will probably
                                    have 1. More sidebar menu selections for more information 2. Animations 3. More
                                    media queries. Thank you for viewing my newbie code skills. Please continue!
                                </p>
                                <p> Time for some unnecessary input: You are probably wondering why this introduction is
                                    so long? It is because I am trying to fill this page as much as possible. I really
                                    want the sidebar clicking to take my readers to a seperate part of the document when
                                    the click in a dramatic way in the future. This paragraph of text is soley for
                                    expiremental and design purposes only. When I learn more about UX Design, this
                                    Introduction will not be as useless. (My apologies for wasting your time if you read
                                    this).</p>
                                <p>Now in this particular documentation, we will be going over what UX Design first.
                                    Then we will go over the main topic: Design Sprints. I will detail what a Design
                                    Sprint is, and its 5 step process: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test.
                                    At the end of this technical documentation, I will give a list of sources that serve
                                    as references for UX Design and Design Sprints, for UX Design is still a new and
                                    evergrowing specialty! Now let's get started...</p>
