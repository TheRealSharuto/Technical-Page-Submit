                                    Hello! My name is Shara Belton and in this document I will presenting the technical
                                    process of a Design Sprint in UX Design. This Technical Document has the purpose of
                                    not only being a submitable project for the awesome website FreeCodeCamp.org, but
                                    also a drill down of information for my own brain as I go through my Google UX
                                    Design Course. There will be two versions of this document. The first will be a
                                    submittable version that will adhere to all the requirements of the Technical Page
                                    Project on FreeCodeCamp. The other version will be a bit more creative with how the
                                    information is presented, for I will go back and make edits as I learn more
                                    Javascript with my current HTML/CSS knowledge. This other version will also have
                                    more information about UX Design that is less of a information dump straight out of
                                    my course, but a rewiring of information from my own brain to put into my own words
                                    as if I am explaining from memory to other people. Additionally, I will probably
                                    have
                                <ul>
                                    <ol>1. More sidebar menu selections for more information</ol><br>
                                    <ol>2. Animations</ol><br>
                                    <ol>3. More
                                        media queries.</ol>
                                </ul>
                                Thank you for viewing my newbie code skills. Please continue!
                                </p>
                                <p> Time for some unnecessary input: You are probably wondering why this introduction is
                                    so long? It is because I am trying to fill this page as much as possible. I really
                                    want the sidebar clicking to take my readers to a seperate part of the document when
                                    the click in a dramatic way in the future. This paragraph of text is soley for
                                    expiremental and design purposes only. When I learn more about UX Design, this
                                    Introduction will not be as useless. (My apologies for wasting your time if you read
                                    this).</p>
                                <p>Now in this particular documentation, we will be going over what UX Design first.
                                    Then we will go over the main topic: Design Sprints. I will detail what a Design
                                    Sprint is, and its 5 step process: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test.
                                    At the end of this technical documentation, I will give a list of sources that serve
                                    as references for UX Design and Design Sprints, for UX Design is still a new and
                                    evergrowing specialty! Now let's get started...</p>

                                    UX means "the user experience". "User Experience" refers to how a person, the user,
                                    feels about interacting with or experiencing a product. User experience (UX) design
                                    is the process design
                                    teams
                                    use
                                    to
                                    create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This
                                    involves
                                    the
                                    design
                                    of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of
                                    branding,
                                    design, usability and function.
                                </p>
                                <p> UX designers design many things - from physical to digital products. It might be a
                                    physical product like a video game controller or a bag of potato chips. They may
                                    also design tech products such as apps, websites, or smartwatches.</p>
                                <p> The UX designer's job is to have all users have a good experience. Therefore, their
                                    products need to be useable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. In other words, the
                                    UX designer must improve products by making them easier to use. They make the
                                    design, structure, and purpose of the design clear to everyone. Then, they consider
                                    the unique needs of many different people in order to make equitable designs, thus,
                                    the designs are made useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and
                                    backgrounds.</p>
                                <p> All in all, UX designers have the purpose of creating a positive connection between
                                    the user and the product by taking a user's thoughts and feelings into
                                    consideration. All of this is achieved with a team of specialists of different
                                    backgrounds - Graphic Designers, UX Designeres, UX Researchers, UX Writers,
                                    Production Designers, Production Designers, Assets, UX engineers, UX Program
                                    managers, Financial advisors, and many more! Many individuals have to work in a team
                                    and do their part in order for ideas for the best user-friendly designs to be put on
                                    the market.</p>

                                <p> A Design Sprint is a time-based process wth five phases typically spread over 5 full
                                    8-hour days. </p>
                                <p> The goal of a Design Sprint is to solve a problem through designing, prototyping,
                                    and testing ideas with users.</p>

                                    <ol> 2. Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh
